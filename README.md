Guess my Number is a fun and simple indie-styled game. It consists of you trying to find the random number that the computer thought of!
Everytime you're above or below the secret number, you will get a "hint" on the message bar, while you'll be lossing score points everytime you "check" the wrong number.
To win, you must find the number with as high score as you can, which will than be transferred to the "highscore", if the current highscore is lower than your current score.
